### Storyline notepad is a website that allows you to plan or outline your next potential story

### I made storyline notepad originally to help (and procrastinate) with a game's base story. Since then I have revisted and added new features :D

## Known issues (Found by me, if you find one that isnt listed here, please open an issue)
  - Having the same storyline open in two tabs or windows will result in one overwriting the other.
  - Storyline Notepad still isnt made for phone users yet.

### Features that will eventually be in storyline notepad:
- More save slots
- More themes
- I COULD ADD THEME RELATED BACKGROUND MUSIC!! (I might, but not a definite yes)
