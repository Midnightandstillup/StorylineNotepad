VER 0.2.2

### Storyline notepad is a website that allows you to plan or outline your next potential story
### I made storyline notepad originally to help (and procrastinate) with a game's base story. Since then i have revisted and added new features :D

All features(subject to current version):
  - Theme changing
  - Import and export storyline data (plan copied data)
  - Storyline title changing
  - Auto saving on exiting, and manual (ctrl + s) saving too
  - Clear all data
  - A cat logo (Will be the actual logo when I think of one)
- 
## Known issues (Found by me, if you find one that isnt listed here, please open an issue)
  - There is only one save slot in localStorage, meaning that data from one storyline can be overwritten by another open storyline window / tab.
    - I have added failsafe's now, so you should.nt lose your storyline when you import 


### Features that will be in the next version:
- The ability to remove boxes anywhere in the storyline
- Being able to add boxes anywhere in the storyline
- More save slots
- Storyline saves will be a file instead of a copied JSON string, possibly under the `.storylinenotepad` file extension
- Better themes
- OH MY GOD I COULD ADD THEME RELATED BACKGROUND MUSIC!! (I might, but not a definite yes)


That's it for this file, i will clean up the project more and release this publically
