### Storyline notepad is a website that allows you to plan or outline your next potential story
### I made storyline notepad originally to help (and procrastinate) with a game's base story. Since then i have revisted and added new features :D

All features(subject to current version):
  - Theme changing (many themes >:3 )
  - Import and export storyline data (plan copied data)
  - Storyline title changing
  - Auto saving on exiting, and manual (ctrl + s) saving too
  - Clear all data
  - 
## Known issues (Found by me, if you find one that isnt listed here, please open an issue)
  - There is only one save slot in localStorage, meaning that data from one storyline can be overwritten by another open storyline window / tab.
    - I have added failsafes now, so you shouldnt lose your storyline when you import or clear data, as "just in case", it copies the data your clearing to your clipboard.
  - Storyline Notepad still isnt made for phone uses yet.

### Features that will be in the next version:
- The ability to remove boxes anywhere in the storyline
- Being able to add boxes anywhere in the storyline
- More save slots
- Storyline saves will be a file instead of a copied JSON string, possibly under the `.storylinenotepad` file extension
- Better themes
- OH MY GOD I COULD ADD THEME RELATED BACKGROUND MUSIC!! (I might, but not a definite yes)
